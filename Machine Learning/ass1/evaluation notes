Choice of regression

For regression problems we used mean square error for model tuning using cross validation
but other methods are possible

ROC curve is a plot of true positive rates to false positive rate
For modeltuning a single valueis preferred ratherthan a curve.
Area under the curve
Ideal classifier AUC=1
random classifier AUC=0.5

cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring=’f1’) ; specify scoring used

Model selection - use cross validation
Model Assessment -
∗ When assessing a model we can use multiple different metrics to capture different aspects of final system e.g. time taken to generate prediction, whether accuracy of prediction changes over time, revenue, user satisfaction.
∗ Using a baseline for comparison (important!)

Best practice is to divide data into 2parts
Training data used for model selection
Test data used to assess prediction
